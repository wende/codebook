This file is a diff of a feature specification. I want you to change the code to match the new spec.

+This will show the stats of the tasks sorted by the data from the most recent
+The stats are calculated for each task by

After completing the task, please update the task file with:
- Description of the feature task that was requested
- Short description of the changes that were made and why
Do not include code snippets. Only describe the functional changes that were made.
Do not remove diff lines from the task file.

--- FEATURE TASK ---
Add a new `codebook task stats` command that displays statistics for all tasks in the project. The command should show for each task (sorted by date, most recent first):
- Number of commits associated with the task
- Number of lines of code changed by the task
- Features (files) modified by the task

--- NOTES ---
The implementation went through several iterations to get the correct behavior:
1. Initially tried to extract commits from time windows, which gave incorrect results
2. Realized the commits should come from git log on the task file itself
3. Fixed diff parsing to only extract file paths from within diff code blocks
4. Added special handling for ongoing tasks (0 commits) to show current uncommitted changes
5. Excluded markdown documentation files from line counts to show only actual code changes

--- SOLUTION ---
Implemented the `codebook task stats` command in the CLI module. The command:

1. Reads all task files from the configured tasks directory sorted by date (most recent first)
2. Parses diff blocks to extract file paths mentioned in each task (only within ```diff blocks)
3. Uses `git log --follow` on the task file itself to find commits that created/modified the task
4. For each commit, uses `git show --numstat` to count total lines changed across all files
5. For ongoing tasks (0 commits), marks them as (ONGOING) and shows current uncommitted changes
6. Excludes markdown files in .codebook/ directory from line counts to focus on actual code
7. Displays formatted statistics with commit count, line changes (+added -removed), feature count, and file list

Key implementation details:
- Commits are tracked by looking at the git history of the task file itself, not by time windows
- Line counts represent actual code changes across all files in those commits
- Ongoing tasks show diff to HEAD excluding documentation files
- Properly handles both YYYYMMDDHHMM and YYYYMMDD date formats in task filenames

Added comprehensive test coverage including tests for:
- Error handling (no tasks directory, not in git repo)
- Basic statistics display
- Multiple tasks with proper sorting
- Multiple files in a single task
- Empty tasks with no diffs
