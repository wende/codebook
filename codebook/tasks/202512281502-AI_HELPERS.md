+# AI Helpers
+
+CodeBook provides a set of AI helpers to help you with your work.
+
+## AI Helper Commands
+
+### `codebook ai help`
+
+Shows the help for the AI helpers.
+
+### `codebook ai review [agent] [path] -- [agent_args]`
+
+Reviews the task with the given agent and path.
+
+Supported agents:
+- claude
+- codex
+- gemini
+- opencode
+- kimi
+
+Agent arguments are passed to the agent as command line arguments.
+Review starts an agent with a specific prompt, that can be customized in the [codebook.yml](./CONFIGURATION.md) config file.
+Default prompt is:
+```
+You are a helpful assistant that reviews the task and provides feedback.
+You are given a task file that contains a diff of the changes that were made to the codebase.
+You need to read the original feature documents that were changed, as well as the diff, and provide feedback on the changes that were made to the codebase. Make sure the documentation describes accurately the changes' functionality.
+Append your feedback to the task file starting with the --- REVIEW YYYYMMDDHHMM --- on top. Do not change any other parts of the task file.
+
+
+This is the task file: [TASK_FILE]
+```
+
+#### Examples
+```bash
+codebook ai review claude ./codebook/tasks/YYYYMMDDHHMM-TITLE.md
+```

--- FEATURE TASK ---
Implement AI helper commands for CodeBook to enable task reviews using various AI agents.

--- NOTES ---
The feature adds `codebook ai` command group with `help` and `review` subcommands.
Review prompt is customizable via codebook.yml config file.

--- SOLUTION ---
Added AI helper functionality to CodeBook with the following changes:

**Configuration (config.py):**
- Added `AIConfig` dataclass with `review_prompt` field
- Added `DEFAULT_REVIEW_PROMPT` constant with the default review prompt template
- Integrated `AIConfig` into `CodeBookConfig` class
- Updated `_from_dict` and `to_dict` methods to handle AI config serialization

**CLI Commands (cli.py):**
- Added `SUPPORTED_AGENTS` constant listing: claude, codex, gemini, opencode, kimi
- Added `ai` command group under main CLI group
- Added `ai help` subcommand that displays available commands and supported agents
- Added `ai review` subcommand that:
  - Takes agent name, task file path, and optional agent arguments
  - Loads review prompt from config and replaces `[TASK_FILE]` placeholder
  - Builds and executes agent-specific command
  - Propagates agent exit code
- Added `_build_agent_command` helper function to construct agent CLI commands

**Agent Command Mapping:**
- claude: `claude --print "<prompt>"`
- codex: `codex "<prompt>"`
- gemini: `gemini "<prompt>"`
- opencode: `opencode "<prompt>"`
- kimi: `kimi "<prompt>"`

**Tests (test_cli.py):**
- Added `TestAICommands` test class with 17 tests covering:
  - Help commands
  - Agent validation
  - Command building for each agent
  - Error handling for missing agents
  - Agent argument passing
  - Verbose output
  - Exit code propagation
--- REVIEW 202512281650 ---
Findings:
- Low: `codebook ai review` accepts directories because `path` is not constrained to files, but docs describe a task file. Consider `dir_okay=False` to align behavior and messaging. `src/codebook/cli.py:1724`
- Low: `agent_args` are appended after the prompt, which can break agents that require options before the prompt argument. Consider inserting args before the prompt or supporting per-agent ordering. `src/codebook/cli.py:1785`

Testing gaps:
- No test covers loading a custom `ai.review_prompt` from config or verifying placeholder replacement in non-default prompts. `tests/test_cli.py:1254`

Docs accuracy:
- `codebook/AI_HELPERS.md` and `codebook/CONFIGURATION.md` match the implemented command surface and default prompt behavior.

Open questions:
- Should `codebook ai review` resolve `codebook.yml` relative to the task file location instead of the current working directory?

--- REVIEW FIXES 202512281733 ---
All review findings have been addressed:

**Fixed: Path validation** (`src/codebook/cli.py:1725`)
- Added `dir_okay=False` to the path argument, ensuring only files are accepted.
- Added `test_ai_review_rejects_directory` test to verify directories are rejected.

**Fixed: Agent args ordering** (`src/codebook/cli.py:1774-1807`)
- Changed `_build_agent_command` to insert `agent_args` before the prompt-related flags/args.
- This ensures agent-specific options come before the prompt, supporting agents that require options first.
- Updated `test_ai_review_with_agent_args` to verify args appear before `--prompt-interactive`.

**Fixed: Test coverage for custom prompts** (`tests/test_cli.py:1523-1559`)
- Added `test_ai_review_custom_prompt_from_config` test that:
  - Creates a `codebook.yml` with custom `ai.review_prompt`
  - Verifies the custom prompt is used
  - Verifies `[TASK_FILE]` placeholder is correctly replaced

**Open question deferred:**
- Config resolution relative to task file vs cwd: Kept current behavior (cwd-based) for consistency with other codebook commands. Can be revisited if use cases emerge.
