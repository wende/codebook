+Default prompt is:
+```
+You are a helpful assistant that reviews the task and provides feedback.
+You are given a task file that contains a diff of the changes that were made to the codebase.
+You need to read the original feature documents that were changed, as well as the diff, and provide feedback on the changes that were made to the codebase. Make sure the documentation describes accurately the changes' functionality.
+Append your feedback to the task file starting with the --- REVIEW YYYYMMDDHHMM --- on top. Do not change any other parts of the task file.
+

--- FEATURE TASK ---
Implement AI helper commands for CodeBook to enable task reviews using various AI agents.

--- NOTES ---
The feature adds `codebook ai` command group with `help` and `review` subcommands.
Review prompt is customizable via codebook.yml config file.

--- SOLUTION ---
Added AI helper functionality to CodeBook with the following changes:

**Configuration (config.py):**
- Added `AIConfig` dataclass with `review_prompt` field
- Added `DEFAULT_REVIEW_PROMPT` constant with the default review prompt template
- Integrated `AIConfig` into `CodeBookConfig` class
- Updated `_from_dict` and `to_dict` methods to handle AI config serialization

**CLI Commands (cli.py):**
- Added `SUPPORTED_AGENTS` constant listing: claude, codex, gemini, opencode, kimi
- Added `ai` command group under main CLI group
- Added `ai help` subcommand that displays available commands and supported agents
- Added `ai review` subcommand that:
  - Takes agent name, task file path, and optional agent arguments
  - Loads review prompt from config and replaces `[TASK_FILE]` placeholder
  - Builds and executes agent-specific command
  - Propagates agent exit code
- Added `_build_agent_command` helper function to construct agent CLI commands

**Agent Command Mapping:**
- claude: `claude --print "<prompt>"`
- codex: `codex "<prompt>"`
- gemini: `gemini "<prompt>"`
- opencode: `opencode "<prompt>"`
- kimi: `kimi "<prompt>"`

**Tests (test_cli.py):**
- Added `TestAICommands` test class with 17 tests covering:
  - Help commands
  - Agent validation
  - Command building for each agent
  - Error handling for missing agents
  - Agent argument passing
  - Verbose output
  - Exit code propagation
