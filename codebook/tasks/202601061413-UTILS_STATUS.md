After completing the task, please update the task file with:
- Description of the feature task that was requested
- Short description of the changes that were made and why

Do not include code snippets. Only describe the functional changes that were made.
Do not remove diff lines from the task file.
--- FEATURE TASK ---
Implement a comprehensive status command for CodeBook that provides health checks and diagnostics for the documentation environment. The command should validate links, check code blocks, gather task statistics, and optionally verify backend/Cicada connectivity.

--- NOTES ---
The implementation expanded the original specification to include:
- Section anchor validation for markdown links (e.g., file.md#heading)
- Python syntax validation for EXEC blocks using ast.parse()
- Endpoint and parameter validation for CICADA blocks
- Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=warnings, 2=errors)
- Optional backend/Cicada connectivity checks via flags

--- SOLUTION ---
Created a new utils module (src/codebook/utils.py) with:
- CodeBookStatusChecker class that validates different link types based on their nature
- StatusReport dataclass to collect and report findings with exit code logic
- LinkValidationResult dataclass for individual validation results

Added utils command group to CLI (src/codebook/cli.py) with:
- utils status command that orchestrates all health checks
- --check-backend and --check-cicada flags for optional connectivity tests
- Formatted output with emoji indicators and sectioned reporting

Validation implementation:
- File references: Checks file existence and validates section anchors by parsing markdown headings and generating GitHub-style slugs
- EXEC blocks: Validates language support (python only) and syntax using ast.parse() without executing code
- CICADA blocks: Validates endpoint names against whitelist and checks required parameters per endpoint type
- Backend/Cicada: Optional HTTP health checks with response time measurement

Created comprehensive test suite (tests/test_utils.py) with 19 test cases covering:
- StatusReport exit code logic
- Task statistics gathering
- All validation types (file links, sections, EXEC, CICADA)
- Edge cases (missing files, syntax errors, invalid endpoints)

The command successfully identified real issues in the codebase including 18 broken file links and 3 invalid CICADA blocks during initial testing.

Moved UTILS.md from project root to codebook/ directory to match the documentation structure expected by the README link.
